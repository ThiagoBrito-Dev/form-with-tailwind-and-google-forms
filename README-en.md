## About the component

<p>
  Styled with TailwindCSS, the component in question (form) sends, when submitted, the information present in its fields to the same URL that would be used by an existing Google Forms form, which, added to the fact that the inputs of the component have the same value for the global attribute "name" as the Google Forms form inputs, it makes the data to be saved, as a response to the Google Forms form itself, in the cloud.
